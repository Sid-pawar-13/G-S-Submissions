Function Name,Function Usage
"random.seed(a=None, version=2)","Initialize the random number generator.If a is omitted or None, the current system time is used.  Ifrandomness sources are provided by the operating system, they are usedinstead of the system time (see the os.urandom() function for detailson availability).If a is an int, it is used directly.With version 2 (the default), a str, bytes, or bytearrayobject gets converted to an int and all of its bits are used.With version 1 (provided for reproducing random sequences from older versionsof Python), the algorithm for str and bytes generates anarrower range of seeds.Changed in version 3.2: Moved to the version 2 scheme which uses all of the bits in a string seed.Deprecated since version 3.9: In the future, the seed must be one of the following types:NoneType, int, float, str,bytes, or bytearray."

random.randbytes(n),Generate n random bytes.This method should not be used for generating security tokens.Use secrets.token_bytes() instead.New in version 3.9.
random.randrange(stop),"Return a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step).  This isequivalent to choice(range(start, stop, step)), but doesnâ€™t actually build arange object.The positional argument pattern matches that of range().  Keyword argumentsshould not be used because the function may use them in unexpected ways.Changed in version 3.2: randrange() is more sophisticated about producing equally distributedvalues.  Formerly it used a style like int(random()*n) which could produceslightly uneven distributions."
random.choice(seq),"Return a random element from the non-empty sequence seq. If seq is empty,raises IndexError."
random.random(),"Return the next random floating point number in the range [0.0, 1.0)."
class random.Random([seed]),"Class that implements the default pseudo-random number generator used by therandom module.Deprecated since version 3.9: In the future, the seed must be one of the following types:NoneType, int, float, str,bytes, or bytearray."
